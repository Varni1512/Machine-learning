## 🌟 About the Challenge
Hey there! I'm **Varnikumar Patel**, a Computer Science and Engineering student at VIT (graduating 2027), embarking on a **100 Days Machine Learning Challenge** starting March 24, 2025. I’m starting with **zero ML knowledge** and aiming to go from basics to advanced topics like NLP, GenAI, and MLOps. This challenge is inspired by the #DrGViswanathan challenge, which motivated me to prepare for my "journey to Mars" (my dreams) over the next 100 days.

A huge thanks to **Shriram Sir** for the motivational email that sparked this journey and **Vishesh Bhaiya** for guiding me in ML!

## 🎯 Goals
- **Learn ML from Scratch**: Go from zero knowledge to advanced topics in 100 days.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - **Days 1-30**: Basics (Python for ML,Mathematics, data preprocessing, visualization).
  - **Days 31-60**: NLP (Natural Language Processing) and GenAI (Generative AI).
  - **Days 61-100**: MLOps (deploying models) and end-to-end ML projects.
- **Build Projects**: Create practical ML projects (e.g., chatbots, text generators).
- **Contribute to Open Source**: Give back to the ML community.
- **Document Progress**: Share daily/weekly updates, code, and learnings here.
